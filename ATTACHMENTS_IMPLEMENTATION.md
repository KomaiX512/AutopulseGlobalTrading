# Attachments and Accessories Implementation

## Overview
This implementation creates a complete "Attachments and Accessories" section that mirrors the existing Heavy Machinery page structure, providing the same filtering, categorization, and navigation functionality.

## ✅ Backend Implementation

### 1. Database Structure
- **Migration**: `2025_06_18_210622_add_category_id_to_attachments_table.php`
  - Added `category_id` field to link attachments to categories
  - Added `price` field for attachment pricing
  - Added `stock` field for inventory management
  - Added foreign key constraint to categories table

### 2. Models Updated
- **Attachment Model** (`app/Models/Attachment.php`)
  - Added `category()` relationship to Category model
  - Updated fillable fields to include `category_id`, `price`, `stock`

### 3. Controllers Enhanced
- **AttachmentController** (`app/Http/Controllers/AttachmentController.php`)
  - Added `filterAttachments()` method for frontend filtering
  - Added `getAttachmentCategories()` method for category management
  - Enhanced with proper category relationships and filtering logic

### 4. API Routes Added
```php
Route::get('filter/attachments', [AttachmentController::class, 'filterAttachments']);
Route::get('get/attachment/categories', [AttachmentController::class, 'getAttachmentCategories']);
```

### 5. Seeders Created
- **AttachmentSeeder**: Creates sample attachments with real data
- **AttachmentCategorySeeder**: Creates attachment-specific categories and links existing attachments

## ✅ Frontend Implementation

### 1. Pages Created
- **AllAttachments.jsx**: Main attachments listing page with filtering (mirrors AllMachines.jsx exactly)
- **AttachmentProductType.jsx**: Categories and featured attachments overview page
- **AttachmentComponent.jsx**: Individual attachment display component

### 2. Navigation Updated
- **ProdDropdown.jsx**: Removed bikes and vehicles, added "Attachments & Accessories"
- Updated to show only "Heavy Machinery" and "Attachments & Accessories"

### 3. Context Methods Added
- `loadAttachmentCategories()`: Loads categories for filtering
- `filterAttachments()`: Handles attachment filtering with same logic as products

### 4. Routes Added
```javascript
// Main attachments page with filtering
<Route path='/products/attachments' element={<AllAttachments />} />

// Categories overview page  
<Route path='/attachments' element={<AttachmentProductType />} />
```

### 5. Homepage Integration
- **AttachmentsSection.jsx**: Updated to navigate to `/products/attachments`
- Removed old navigation to machine page with attachment filter

## 🎯 Features Implemented

1. **Sort Options**: New First, Old First
2. **Type Filter**: Business Attachments, Customer Attachments, Both
3. **Price Sorting**: Low to High, High to Low  
4. **Category Filter**: Multi-select category filtering
